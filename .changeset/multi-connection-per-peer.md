Multiple independent connections per peer (issue #116). Previously `WebRTCMeshManager.connectToPeer()` hard-deduped by `remotePodId` alone, so a peer already connected to could never get a second, independently-negotiated `RTCPeerConnection` -- and `PeerNode`, `webrtc-negotiator.mjs`'s signaling correlation, and `mesh-hardening.mjs`'s per-peer retry/failover/metrics scoping all assumed the same one-connection-per-peer shape.

All of that is now additive and opt-in via a `connectionId` (defaults to `'default'`, so every existing call site is unaffected):

- `WebRTCMeshManager.connectToPeer(remotePodId, { connectionId })` opens (or returns) an independent `RTCPeerConnection`, with its own ICE/STUN/DTLS negotiation and its own reconnect backoff. New `getConnectionsFor()`; `getConnection()`, `hasConnection()`, `listConnections()`, `closePeer()`, `broadcast()`, `getAllConnectionStats()` all became connectionId-aware.
- `webrtc-negotiator.mjs` and `signaling.mjs` thread `connectionId` through the offer/answer/ICE exchange so two concurrent negotiations with the same peer never cross-route an answer or candidate.
- `PeerNode.connectToPeer()`/`adoptIncomingSession()` tag the session they create with `connectionId`; `sendTo()`/`hasActiveSession()` accept an optional `connectionId` to address a specific one instead of always falling back to "most recently created". New `PeerNode.sessionsFor(pubKey)`.
- `mesh-hardening.mjs`'s `endpointsKey(endpoints, auth)` folds `auth.connectionId` into its key. Without this fix a second `connectToPeer()` call with a different `connectionId` silently reused the first call's cached `TransportFailover` and reconnected *that* connection instead of ever negotiating its own -- a real bug on the hardened path, not just a missing feature.
- `@johnhenry/browsermesh-core`'s `ConnectionPool.add(peerId, transport, { purpose })` / `acquire(peerId, { purpose, select })` gained a real selector, answering the issue's second open question ("no way to request 'the connection for purpose X'").
