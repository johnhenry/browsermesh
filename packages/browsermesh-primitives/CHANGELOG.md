## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- Fix TypeScript declarations not being resolved (#179).

  `browsermesh-primitives` shipped `src/index.d.ts`, but its `exports` map
  used a bare string target with no `types` condition (and no top-level
  `types` field), so TypeScript ignored the sibling declaration file
  entirely and consumers hit `TS7016` on every import. `exports["."]` now
  has an explicit `types` condition (checked first) alongside `import`,
  and a top-level `types` field points at the same file.

  `browsermesh-pod` shipped no declarations at all, even though `Pod` and
  `BroadcastChannelTransport` are real public exports the tutorial docs
  use. It now ships `src/index.d.ts` covering its full public surface —
  `Pod`, `InjectedPod`, `detectPodKind`, `detectCapabilities`, the
  transport adapters (`BroadcastChannelTransport`, `EventEmitterTransport`,
  `NullTransport`), the discovery adapters (`TransportDiscovery`,
  `NullDiscovery`), the wire-protocol message constants and factories, and
  the `installPodRuntime` / `createRuntime` / `createClient` /
  `createServer` runtime entrypoints — wired into `package.json` the same
  way as primitives.

### Patch Changes

- Feature-detect the platform floors instead of crashing on them.

## 0.0.0

Imported into the `@johnhenry` npm scope as part of the browsermesh
monorepo consolidation. Previously published unscoped as
`browsermesh-primitives@0.1.1`. Per family convention, the version restarts
at 0.0.0 on scope import — see the README's Provenance section.

## 0.1.1 (unreleased entry, retroactively documented)

- Minimum Node.js bumped to 24.
- Added CodeQL and dependency-review CI workflows.

## 0.1.0 (2026-03-15)

Initial release.

- **Identity**: `PodIdentity` with Ed25519 key generation, signing, and verification; `derivePodId` for deterministic pod IDs; base64url encode/decode utilities
- **Wire format**: `encodeMeshMessage` / `decodeMeshMessage` with extensible message type registry
- **Capabilities**: `CapabilityToken` with scope parsing and matching (`parseScope`, `matchScope`)
- **Trust**: `createTrustEdge`, `computeTransitiveTrust` across configurable trust categories
- **ACL**: `ACLEngine` with resource pattern matching, `Permission` and `AccessGrant` primitives
- **CRDTs**: `VectorClock`, `LWWRegister`, `GCounter`, `PNCounter`, `ORSet`, `RGA`, `LWWMap` -- all with merge, toJSON/fromJSON round-trip
- **Test utilities**: `DeterministicRNG`, `LocalChannel`, `createLocalChannelPair`, `TestMesh`
